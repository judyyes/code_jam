We are planning to implement a html-based interface that will be intuitive for 
all members of the school to interate with, detailed instructions will be provided 
once the webpage is complete.

> To calculate a match, run the test.py file while will generate a json and the optimal number of spots.
> However, if we were not able to finish the interface in time, you may always 
> download the `388.json`file and copy its cotent to a JSON viewer such as
> the one on http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ .
> From there, you will be able to interate with your schedule by combining the powerful 
> shortcut **Ctrl + F** with your student ID or your class ID.

> The GUI is just not there yet, CSS and HTML are done but parsing in JS is failed.
> Files can be reviewed from codeJam_UI sub folder.
